This repository shows the code I used to generate the images and videos shown in the article attached.

When running the code, I suggest that you: 
1) run the Half-Cheetah-v4 Implementation on the notebook cell by cell
2) save the model, logs, evaluation and tensorboard
3) upload them to the video.py and plot.py files to obtain the desired outputs
